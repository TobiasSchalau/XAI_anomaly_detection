# XAI_anomaly_detection

## Seminar Cybersecurity and AI
#### Subject: Explainable AI in context of anomaly detection

## Description
The paper of Mane and Rao (Explaining Network Intrusion Detection System Using Explainable AI Framework, 2021) presented a framework with different explainable AI techniques for analysing a fully connected deep neural network. Implemented AI techiques are SHAP, Protodash, BRCG, LIME and CEM.

This project implemented the explainable AI methods proposed in the paper to get explaination for NSL-KDD data set and a fully connected DNN trained on this data set.

## Structure
Basically, the project has three parts:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Creation
3. Method execution

Each step is implemented in a seperated class. A Jupyter notebook is implemented to invokes the different steps and present the results.
